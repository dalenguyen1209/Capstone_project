    "#### Prospects of a opening an Indian Restaurant in Toronto, Canada.\n",
    "Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is the most populous Canadian city. Its diversity is reflected in Torontoâ€™s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal & Roncesvalles. One of the most immigrant-friendly cities in North America with more than half of the entire Indian Canadian population residing in Toronto it is one of the best places to start an Indian restaurant.\n",
    "In this project we will go through step by step process to make a decision whether it is a good idea to open an Indian restaurant. We analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area since the success of the restaurant depends on the people and ambience. Since we already know that Toronto shelter a greater number of Indians than any other city in Canada, it is a good idea to start the restaurant here, but we just need to make sure whether it is a profitable idea or not. If so, where we can place it, so it yields more profit to the owner."
